# hello-world

My name is Mading, I'm here to learn Git and Github. I like to code useless piece of Apps just so I can say I'm proud of my work.

But in all seriousness, I am a web developer who is in the process of joining a freelance world.

I might need a hand here and there but colloboration is my cup of tea, I am not British though :)

welcome to my Github profile.
